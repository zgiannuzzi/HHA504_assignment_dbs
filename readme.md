## Review 
- Both Azures and GCPs monitoring sections are pretty robust and allow you to customize what you would like to see. 
- Both also have ways of creating flexibilty with the Databases with dynamic storage and precessing power if needed.
- I did however find that GCP was easier to find the information on the databasse query easier.
- In my opinion GCP seems to be more user friendly.
